# Connect-4-project

This is my first project in programming.
This project is the known game "Connect 4".
The game is for 2 player against each other.

The rules are simple:
- player 1 is the first to start. the symbol of player 1 is "X".
- player 2 is the second to play. the symbol of player 2 is "O".
- you need to enter a numeric value. the correct value is between 1 to 7.
- each player have to make combination of 4 symbols in a row, column or diagonally. The first player who succeed, win the game.
- when you arrive to full column you will need to make another choose.
- compete each other and have fun!
